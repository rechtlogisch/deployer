## Known issues

### Access private repositories with your Pipeline SSH Key.

If you want to have access to private repositories during deployment on a remote host and donâ€™t want to setup a private key on this remote host - you could use the Pipeline SSH Key.

For this to work the SSH Key agent has to be started inside the container and the native Pipeline SSH Key has to be forwarded using the agent.

Add the following lines to your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` scripts before the deploy line:

```
- eval $(ssh-agent)
- ssh-add -k $(head -n 1 ~/.ssh/config | sed 's/IdentityFile //')
```

Do not forget to add the public key of your Pipeline as an Access Key of the repository you want to retrieve during deployment.
